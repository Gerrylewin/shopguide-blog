Isaac Lewin is a Growth Operator at ShopGuide, where he focuses on agentic commerce for Shopify stores. His background stems from direct sales, marketing agencies, and agentic web development.

**Specialty** – His expertise lies between value engineering and understanding customers, helping merchants optimize their e-commerce operations for the future of autonomous shopping.

**Vision** – After installing ShopGuide on the <a href="https://countrylifefoods.com" className="text-primary-500 hover:text-primary-600 dark:text-primary-500 dark:hover:text-primary-400">Country Life Natural Foods</a> website, Isaac immediately saw the potential for every store with a large catalog to have the same benefits. His goal is to help as many merchants as he possibly can transform their stores with agentic commerce.

Isaac writes about agentic commerce, AI-driven customer experiences, and the future of e-commerce on the ShopGuide blog.
